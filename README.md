# woolongWLNG
Welcome to the intergalactic world of Woolongs.

The Woolong (trade symbol: WLNG, icon: W with only 1-line traversing horizontally just above center) is the standard unit of currency in the Solar System. Woolong (WLNG) can be traded in physical paper notes, metallic minted coins, digitally transferred electronically through user interface (computer), or with special devices.

Woolong (WLNG), a Bep-20 contract token, has increased value by 404.98% in the past seven days.

Woolong, a private, secure, and fast cryptocurrency designed for exchanges between galaxies and everyday transactions, was brought about by Cowboy Bebop, an animated science-fiction series.  On the 3rd of April, 1998, Sunrise, a Japanese studio for animation, released Cowboy Bebop. Keiko Nobumoto was the writer of Cowboy Bebop, while Shinichirō Watanabe was the director.

Cowboy Bebop is now an American Science Fiction which is set to be streamed as a television series on Netflix on the 19th of November, 2021. This series was developed by André Nemec, written by Christopher Yost, starring stars like John Cho, Elena Satine, Mustafa Shakir, Alex Hassell, and Daniela Pineda.

In this series in 1998, we could see the Woolong used for different transactions and other contracts for bounties among galaxies. The concept of cryptocurrency was first introduced in this series long before Bitcoin was launched in 2009, which is almost ten years difference.

In addition, both of the following animated series use Woolong as their galactic currency.

Space Dandy: Although Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy are very different in tone and setting, there is abundant evidence that Space Dandy takes place in the same universe as Cowboy Bebop, although likely at a much later point in time.

Carole & Tuesday: Carol & Tuesday is pretty different from the Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy series. For one thing, it's barely science fiction. It takes place on Mars, and AI is commonplace, but the story itself could take place in almost any time period and location. Instead of being about a small crew of eccentric heroes traveling through space and struggling to make a living, it's about two young girls attempting to hit it big as musicians. Despite this change in basic plot structure, there is abundant evidence that Carole & Tuesday also take place in Cowboy Bebop's universe.  Woolongs are also the currency here (although their value seems to be different)
Woolong (WLNG) Token is referred to as a fan token however its function is very similar to a cryptocurrency coin, with over 1,000,000 loyal fans of the legendary series, which is one of the reasons why Woolong is choosing Binance Smart Chain (BSC) as the platform for its algorithm. Another reason is the platform's massive success and the opportunities available for Fan Tokens. Furthermore, this collaboration between this fan token and Binance Smart Chain helps promote the security of these tokens.
Woolong Token was made by people who have a passion for anime with creative flairs like Cowboy Bebop, Space Dandy, and Carol & Tuesday, which all have a futuristic concept, focusing on an adventure whose method of currency was based on the digital currency named Woolong. Although this is not the first-time fans of this series have tried to recreate this digital currency, other attempts failed due to unforeseen circumstances; it was formed by individuals with the same mind and passion for making sure to produce this Token this time successfully.

The producers of this WLNG Token produced a total of 10,000,000 Tokens with 8 decimal (0.00000000) places and the smallest of which is called “WOO” (1 WOO = 0.00000001 Woolong.) This proportioning will facilitate the galactic distribution in line with the trillions of WOO that are dispersed in each of these three animated series.
Ideally, at least one Woolong WLNG (1.00000000) will be received by everyone who loves this iconic series. To get a Woolong, all that is needed is to register an account on the Woolong site (Woolongs.com), which is free, and provide an account number for your BSC Mainnet Account; once that is done, a free Woolong will be sent to your account, and these can be traded on PancakeSwap.

Three million pieces of the WLNG Token, 15% of the total WLNG produced, would be made available before the official launch for a pre-sale event (ICO/AIRDROP). The producers would give  WLNG 2,000,000 (20% of the 10,000,000 Tokens) to the Advisors of the various Teams to help this coin align with the Cryptocurrency community, and 65% would be available for sale to a general crypto exchange user.

The producers made this Token to let fans who are avid lovers of the series Cowboy Bebop, Space Dandy, and Carol & Tuesday and who love the concept of the digital currency, get to have a real-life experience of it and make sure everything is done securely.
