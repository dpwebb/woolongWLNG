Welcome to the intergalactic world of Woolongs.

The Woolong (trade symbol: WLNG, icon: W with only 1-line traversing horizontally just above center) is the standard unit of currency in the Solar System. Woolong (WLNG) can be traded in physical paper notes, metallic minted coins, digitally transferred electronically through user interface (computer), or with special devices. 

Woolong references in Anime:
•	Cowboy Bebop
•	Space Dandy
•	Carol & Tuesday

Cowboy Bebop
In 1998, Japanese animation studio Sunrise launched a new animated science-fiction television series called Cowboy Bebop. Directed by Shinichirō Watanabe and written by Keiko Nobumoto, Cowboy Bebop first premiered to Western audiences in 2001, capturing the attention of millions of fans around the world. Cowboy Bebop’s eclectic blend of neo-noir cyberpunk aesthetic, incandescent jazz, and deeply nuanced storytelling rapidly enshrined the series as a legendary cult classic. As a genre-breaking science fiction series, Cowboy Bebop presents viewers with a vast range of futuristic concepts, focusing on a lawless, socially-stratified solar system in which governments offer bounty contracts to prevent crime. These contracts, and everything else in the Cowboy Bebop Universe, are paid in “Woolong” — one of the earliest depictions of digital currency in pop culture.

Space Dandy
Although Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy are very different in tone and setting, there is abundant evidence that Space Dandy takes place in the same universe as Cowboy Bebop, although likely at a much later point in time. Both series use the Woolong as their currency. 

Carole & Tuesday
Carole & Tuesday is pretty different from the Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy series. For one thing, it's barely science fiction. It takes place on Mars, and AI is commonplace, but the story itself could take place in almost any time period and location. Instead of being about a small crew of eccentric heroes travelling through space and struggling to make a living, it's about two young girls attempting to hit it big as musicians. Despite this change in basic plot structure, there is abundant evidence that Carole & Tuesday also takes place in Cowboy Bebop's universe. Woolongs are also the currency here (although their value seems to be different)

Why Woolongs?

Bitcoin — the first widely adopted crypto currency — was created with the vision of establishing a decentralized digital currency without the need for a centralized bank or administrator. While Bitcoin has achieved the original goals outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, the rapidly-evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem has established a system in which Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are no longer truly decoupled from fiat currency.

Ever-increasing regulatory oversight and the development of advanced chain analysis techniques have rendered traditional blockchain networks such as Bitcoin transparent, allowing governments and regulatory authorities to collect information about cryptocurrency users through a wide range of methods.

Cryptocurrency is a means of storing and transferring value outside of state-issued fiat currency, and holds far more use cases than a simple extension of fiat, or as a speculative investment vehicle. Cryptocurrencies hold the potential to provide users with a truly democratic, anonymous, and fungible means of transferring value from between individuals regardless of distance. Woolong (WLNG) provides users with the ability to transfer value privately and quickly between individuals, across the planet, or from Ganymede to Callisto.

Woolong (WLNG) provides cryptocurrency users with a means of storing and transferring value in a truly private manner, facilitating the execution of confidential transactions. Woolong (WLNG) is fast, efficient, and secure — ideal for day-to-day transactions or the remittance of intersolar bounties.

The Woolong (WLNG), uses the Binance Smart Contract algorithm. Shinichirō Watanabe’s fictional Woolong is used within the Cowboy Bebop, Space Dandy, and Carol & Tuesday universe as a universal currency, used to purchase real estate, food, pets, and for the payment of intergalactic bounty contracts.

Highly Secure
Woolong (WLNG) is a decentralized cryptocurrency. In contrast with state-issued fiat currencies, Woolong (WLNG) is a secure digital currency maintained by a vast network of individual users. Woolong (WLNG) network participants confirm transactions and balances through a distributed consensus model and record them on the immutable BscScan blockchain.

The conventional cryptocurrency ecosystem is stagnant — we must create new dreams and technologies by breaking traditional styles. The next generation of cryptocurrencies, which becomes a new currency itself, will be called… Woolong (WLNG)
